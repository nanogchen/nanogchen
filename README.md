## Hi I'm Guang Chen

An enthusiast in computational chemistry and physics of soft condensed matters, trained on multiple engineering fields 
(civil engineering/mechanical engineering/materials science), and especially love computational science. Here, I share the code developed in my research 
and hope it will be helpful to the community:
- continuum mechanics using finite element or meshfree (RKPM) for elasticity, viscoelasticity, and viscoplasticity
- recurrent neural networks for history-dependent materials
- drug membrane interaction using molecular dynamics simulations and machine learning
- inverse molecular design using recurrent neural network
- molecular structure and topology generation of polymer-grafted hybrid nanostructures (pr-eprocessing of MD)
- molecular dynamics simulations and trajectory analysis (post-processing of MD)
