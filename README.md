## Hi I'm Guang Chen

I hold a PhD in Materials Science and am interested in soft condensed matters using computational chemistry and physics. Here, I share the code developed in my research 
and hope it will be helpful to the community:
- continuum mechanics using finite element or meshfree (RKPM) for elasticity, viscoelasticity, and viscoplasticity
- recurrent neural networks for history-dependent materials
- inverse molecular design using recurrent neural network
- molecular structure and topology generation of polymer-grafted hybrid nanostructures (pre-processing of MD)
- molecular dynamics simulations and trajectory analysis (post-processing of MD)

Accompanying this, I have written some tutorials on how to do those with more details, see [my web](https://www.gchenlab.com/tutorials/).
