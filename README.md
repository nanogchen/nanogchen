## Hi I'm Guang Chen

An enthusiast in computational chemistry and physics for the soft condensed matter. I've been trained on multiple engineering fields 
(civil engineering/mechanical engineering/materials science), and especially love computational science. Here, I share the code developed in my research 
and hope it will be helpful to the community:
- continumm mechanics using finite element or meshfree (RKPM) for elasticity and viscoelasticity
- recurrent nerual network for history dependent materials
- drug membrane interaction using molecular dynamics simulations and machine learning
- molecular dynamics simulations and trajectory analysis
